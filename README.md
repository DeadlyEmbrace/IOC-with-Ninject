IOC-with-Ninject
================

Create a simple example of an IOC Container using Ninject. I plan to make several changes to the original code but for now I will start with this. In the mean time this code should work as is.

1) I want the container to work with the service, not the guitar. UPDATE: This change has been implemented.
